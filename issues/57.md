# Issue 57 — Reaction Roles Manager

This document explains how to use the Reaction Roles Manager (implemented via the `/reaction` command with subcommands), expected formats for emoji, examples, and a manual test checklist for maintainers.

Command overview

The bot exposes a single admin command: `/reaction` with subcommands:

- `create` — Attach a reaction-role mapping to an existing message.
  - Options:
    - `channel` (Channel) — channel containing the target message
    - `message_id` (String) — ID of the message to attach to
    - `emoji` (String) — emoji to watch for (unicode or custom `name:id`)
    - `role` (Role) — role to assign when reacted
    - `label` (String, optional) — small human-readable label stored with the mapping

- `list` — List mappings for the guild.

- `delete` — Delete a mapping by its `_id` (returned by `create` or shown in `list`).

Notes on emoji formats

- Unicode emoji: use the emoji character itself (for example `✅`, `👍`).
- Custom guild emoji: use the `name:id` format (for example `cool_emoji:123456789012345678`).
  - The bot will attempt to react with the provided emoji; if the bot lacks access to the custom emoji (different guild) the reaction may fail silently.

Examples and notes for custom emoji

- When storing or accepting emoji input from admin commands prefer the canonical `name:id` representation for server (custom) emoji. Examples:
   - party_parrot:827364827364827364
   - my_cool_emoji:123456789012345678
- If an admin supplies only a numeric ID or only a name, normalize when possible:
   - numeric-only: look up in `guild.emojis.cache.get(id)` to find the emoji name
   - name-only: look up in `guild.emojis.cache.find(e => e.name === name)` to resolve an id
- Note: custom emojis are guild-scoped. Reacting with `name:id` will only succeed if the bot can use that emoji (it must be available to the bot's account). If not available, the bot's `.react()` call will fail with a permission or invalid emoji error.

Permissions & common failure modes (troubleshooting)

- Required bot permissions (guild + channel):
   - Add Reactions
   - Read Message History
   - View Channel
   - Manage Roles (if assigning/removing roles)
   - Manage Messages (optional: if the bot removes reactions or edits messages)

- Common failure modes and diagnostics:
   1) Missing 'Add Reactions' — attempting to add a reaction will throw a DiscordAPIError (50013) or fail silently. Check the bot's channel-level permissions and grant "Add Reactions".
   2) Missing 'Manage Roles' — the role assignment will fail when trying to add/remove roles. Ensure the bot has Manage Roles and its role is higher than any role it needs to assign.
   3) Rate limits (HTTP 429) — if the bot reacts quickly across many messages it may hit rate limits. The implementation uses exponential backoff for `.react()`; if you see repeated 429s, reduce batching or add delays.
   4) Invalid custom emoji — if the admin supplies an emoji that doesn't exist or the bot cannot access it, `.react()` will fail. Prefer normalizing inputs to `name:id` and verifying the emoji via `guild.emojis.cache` during create.
   5) Message deleted / missing — the cleanup job should remove stale mappings; if a mapping references a deleted message, reaction attempts will be skipped and a debug log entry may be emitted.

- Quick debugging steps:
   - Verify the bot's permissions in the channel (Edit Channel -> Permissions).
   - Try reacting manually with a small test script or run `/reaction create` and watch the bot's attempt in the channel.
   - Check the configured logs channel (if enabled) for error embeds produced by `sendGuildLog`.
   - Confirm the bot's role position is above roles it needs to manage.

Behavior

- `create` persists a document: { guildId, channelId, messageId, emoji, roleId, label }.
- `create` will attempt to react to the target message (best-effort) so the emoji is present on the message for users to click.
- When a user adds a reaction, the `reactionRolesAdd` event handler consults the DB and assigns the configured role(s). The inverse handler removes the role on reaction removal.

Manual test checklist

1. Setup
   - Ensure the bot has the following permissions in the guild and target channel: Add Reactions, Read Message History, View Channel, Manage Roles (to assign roles).
   - Ensure the bot's role is above the target role in the server's role hierarchy.

2. Create a mapping
   - In a test server, pick a message and run `/reaction create channel:#some-channel message_id:123456789012345678 emoji:✅ role:@Member`.
   - The command should reply with a mapping id.
   - Inspect the message — the emoji should be present (bot attempted to add it).

3. React as a non-admin user
   - Click the reaction on the message.
   - The user should receive the role configured in the mapping.
   - Remove the reaction; the role should be removed.

4. List mappings
   - Run `/reaction list` and confirm the mapping is present with the `_id`, channel, message id, emoji, and role mention.

5. Delete mapping
   - Use `/reaction delete id:<mappingId>` and confirm it returns success.
   - Confirm `/reaction list` no longer shows the mapping.

6. Edge cases to verify manually
   - Invalid emoji: try `emoji:doesnotexist` — the command should still create a mapping (it stores the string) but the bot may not be able to react; document limitations.
   - Role removed from guild: delete the role in the server, then attempt to react — the handler should not throw. If mappings remain, consider cleaning them up.
   - Message deleted: delete the target message and then react elsewhere; handler should silently ignore missing messageId mappings.

Suggested follow-ups (to mark feature as complete)

- Add server-side docs in `README.md` or `docs/reactionRoles.md` with screenshots and example commands.
- Add tests for edge cases: invalid emoji, missing role, message deleted, duplicate mapping prevention, permission failures.
- Add an administrative audit log when mappings are created/deleted (post to the configured logs channel via `ChanLogger`).
- Optionally implement `create` to accept a `message_content` option so the bot can create the message itself and pre-react (improves UX).

If you'd like, I can implement any of the follow-ups now. I can also add the `issues/57.md` entry to the repository and push it if you want me to commit it.

Quick manual checklist

- Verify the bot logs creation/deletion to the configured logs channel (if configured in server settings). Check that the embed includes mapping id, channel, message id, emoji, and role.
- After creating mappings, test reacting/removing reactions with a regular user to validate assign/remove behavior.
