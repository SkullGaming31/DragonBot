# DragonBot Docs

Welcome to the DragonBot documentation. This folder is used as the GitHub Pages source so visitors can browse docs from the repository.

## Quick links

- [Reaction Roles Manager](./reactionRoles.md)
- [Docker Run](./DOCKER_RUN.md)
- [Project README](../README.md)
 - [Starboard (Message Highlights)](./starboard.md)

If GitHub Pages still doesn't show the docs after this file is present, ensure the repository's Pages settings point to the `docs/` folder on the `main`/`master` branch or use the `gh-pages` workflow to publish.
